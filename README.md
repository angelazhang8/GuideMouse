# Guide Mouse

![mouse](wwsef/img.JPG)

Guide Mouse was developed with the aim of allowing the exploration of 3D objects in a virtual environment. The program inputs a 3D model while displaying its 2D projection on the screen. Users will move the tactile mouse and change the cursor position. By tracking the cursor position, the program identifies the visible facet the cursor is hovering over and outputs three values that would drive motors to position a feedback plane attached to the mouse.
