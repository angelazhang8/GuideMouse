# Guide Mouse

![mouse](https://github.com/xxxzhangxxx/GuideMouse/blob/master/reports/img.JPG)

Guide Mouse allows for the tactile exploration of 3D objects digitally. The program inputs a 3D model while displaying its 2D projection on the screen. Users move the tactile mouse around like a regular computer mouse, which changes the cursor position on the screen. Applicator (the main program running Guide Mouse) identifies the facet of the 3D polyhedron mesh the cursor hovers over on the screen, and it outputs three numerical values to drive three motors to position a feedback plane that is attached to Guide Mouse.
